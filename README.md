# Autorespond Bot

A [hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot) that responds to any message with a predefined autoresponse.

This repo is setup to work with XMPP and GTalk adapters, but you could add your own...

# Usage

Set the environment var `HUBOT_AUTORESPOND_MSG` to whatever you like. You can see samples of gtalk/xmpp configs in `gtalk.sh` and `xmpp.sh` respectively.
